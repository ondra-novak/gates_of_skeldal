329,"A wondrous, ancient, island,"
376,"where the primordial gods rested,
when they created the world."
446,"Last of the world's fragments, "
478,"where primal magic yet courses, "
525,"and the earth, water, and trees pulse with the gods' might."
687,My name is Freghar.
717,"I devoted my life
to the study of these very forces,"
780,that the gods themselves left for us.
839,"Yet ancient prophecies from times
when the world was still young,"
897,now begin to be fulfilled.
935,"The balance is broken.

of the encroaching darkness,"
1090,"and with the help of magic
I searched every corner of the island."

1247,"And when my vision,
clouded and weakened in mind,"
1295,"cleared, I saw someone powerful
drawing mana from the earth and concentrating it."
1370,Darkness spreads onward...
